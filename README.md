This package provides a validator that ensures strong passwords in Laravel 4 & 5 applications. It is influenced  a lot by [PasswordStrengthBundle for Symfony 2](https://github.com/jbafford/PasswordStrengthBundle).

It is out now for a while and since there were no complaints it very likely fulfills its purpose.

The provided validations include:

- check if input contains alphabetic characters
- check if input contains numeric characters
- check if input contains mixed case characters
- check if input contains symbols

# Documentation

## Installation

### Get the package

**For Laravel 4 users**

Just ```composer require schuppo/password-strength:"~0.10"```.

**For Laravel 5 users**

Just ```composer require schuppo/password-strength:"~1.5"```.

### Initialize the package

> If you do run the package on Laravel 5.5+, you can start using the package at this point. [package auto-discovery](https://medium.com/@taylorotwell/package-auto-discovery-in-laravel-5-5-ea9e3ab20518) takes care of the magic of adding the service provider.


If you do not run Laravel 5.5 (or higher), then add the following line under the `providers` array key in *app/config.php*:

```php
// app/config/app.php
return array(
    // ...
    'providers' => array(
        // ...
        \Schuppo\PasswordStrength\PasswordStrengthServiceProvider::class,
    );
    // ...
);
```

**Caution**

I recently recognized a small conflict in the usage of this package in combination with [unique-with](https://github.com/felixkiss/uniquewith-validator): One runs into problems when adding the ```PasswordStrengthServiceProvider``` **after** ```UniqueWithValidatorServiceProvider``` to the providers array, the  rules of this package stay unknown to the Laravel ```Validator```.

The problem is easy to fix though: Just add the service provider of this package in front of the service provider of *unique-with*. In that order both packages work fine.

## Usage
Now Laravel's native `Validator` is extended by four rules:

- case_diff
- numbers
- letters
- symbols

### Example
You can apply these rules as described in the [validation section on Laravel's website](http://laravel.com/docs/validation)

```php
$v = Validator::make(
    array(
        'password' => '12345QWERTqwert@'
    ),
    array(,
        'password' => 'case_diff|numbers|letters|symbols'
    )
);
$v->passes();   // returns true;
```

Notice that you can validate any value with the new rules. The only reason why this package is called "Password Strength Package" is that it describes its foremost purpose.

Any suggestions?
